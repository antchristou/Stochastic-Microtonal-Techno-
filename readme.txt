The samples are expected to be at:

thisProcess.nowExecutingPath.dirname

Which is where they should be so long as nothing is moved from the folder in which it everything provided in.

Basically, as long as the SuperCollider file is opened from and the samples aren't moved from the downloaded folder, it should work without making any changes (to my understanding, apologies if that isn't the case).
